# What constitutes a Security Breach and how is it different to a Data Breach?

# <a id="definitions">Definitions</a>

## <a id="sec_breach">Security Breach</a>
Kaspersky resource center's defines it like this:

> "A security breach is any incident that results in unauthorized access to computer data, applications, networks or devices. It results in information being accessed without authorization. Typically, it occurs when an intruder can bypass security mechanisms."

The GDPR by the European Union defines it like this:
> "... a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed."

## <a id="data_breach">Data Breach</a>
Kaspersky resource center's definition:

> "... a data breach exposes confidential, sensitive, or protected information to an unauthorized person. The files in a data breach are viewed and/or shared without permission.
>
> Anyone can be at risk of a data breach â€” from individuals to high-level enterprises and governments. More importantly, anyone can put others at risk if they are not protected."

# <a id="diff">So, what's the difference?</a>

The difference here is the degree of commitment the cybercriminal has to achieve. Whilst in a different dimension, a burglar could pickpocket your phone or steal your laptop and take them away, this would be the equivalent of a data breach where the data is leaked. Following the simile, the equivalent to the burglar breaking into a facility bypassing the security in place and stealing a safe full of money would be a cybercriminal exploiting one or several vulnerabilities in your system, accessing by these means to your crown jewels.

Information that is classified or private holds great value in the black market. Identity theft is a real problem a lot of people start facing when they were sure it wouldn't happen to them as it happens in the movies. A legitimate company whose card machines are compromised may be leaking the details of the credit card you just used with them, an event that would lead to your credit card being sold down the deep web within in a bundle of thousands of credit cards obtained the same way and you didn't do anything wrong. In the UK the [ICO](https://ico.org.uk/) ensures to prosecute all those companies who don't pay due diligence at the time of securing your information safely. 
Security breaches lead to huge fines as a penalty to push private companies to treat cybersecurity as a matter of urgency. In other countries also exist similar organisms and agencies and on average, the bill for allowing a malicious actor to obtain data from customers is nearly $4m for multinationals.

To fully understand why companies are fined, we must also explain that there also exist two kinds of security issues; We already talked about security breaches but we didn't cover security incidents. Whilst an incident may be related to an active cyber attack (social engineering, DDoS, malware, etc), it doesn't always lead to the bad actor obtaining either access to the corporate network or actual data, so whilst they are attacks, they are not considered as a security breach. Using our favourite simile, a security incident setting our story would be the burglar being caught by the police whilst trying to escape from a bank robbery.
